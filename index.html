            <p>Where to start with? Basically this entire journey was spawned from a mid mid-life crisis, I was heading nowhere with my life, my plans
                for the futer had been slightly halted when I was constantly denied a real admission at UCSD, so it became time to adapt or waste away
                in my mothers basement, watching anime and growing an amazing neck beard, my mother doesn't even have a basement.
