                    <p>Where to start with? Basically this entire journey was spawned from a mid mid-life crisis, I was heading nowhere with my life, my plans
                        for the futer had been slightly halted when I was constantly denied a real admission at UCSD, so it became time to adapt or waste away
                        in my mothers basement, watching anime and growing an amazing neck beard, my mother doesn't even have a basement.
                    </p>

                    <p>So one of the most important things I cna attribute to any person that knows me is that after years of working at the restaurant 
                        that my father owns I am amazing at pot lucks.
